## Install

```sh
yarn add @component-controls/storybook --dev
```

## Configure

### Default options

The default options will configure `component-controls` to work with react apps,  with `react-docgen` for prop-types and `react-docgen-typescript` for typescript props information

In `main.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  addons: ['@component-controls/storybook']
}
```

### Using only `react-docgen` (even for typescript)

Currently this is not recommended as the typescript support in `react-docgen` is a bit lagging.

in `main.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  addons: [{
    name: '@component-controls/storybook',
    options: {
      webpack: ['react-docgen'],
    }
  }]
}
```

### Use built-in instrument for everything (not using storybook `addon-docs` at all)

The following options will bypass the loaders installed by `addon-docs` and will rely only on the instrumenting loaders from `component-controls`

in `main.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  addons: [{
    name: '@component-controls/storybook',
    options: {
      webpack: ['instrument', 'react-docgen-typescript'],
    }
  }]
}  
```
