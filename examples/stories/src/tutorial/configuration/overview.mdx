## Configuration path

The two configuration files are stored in a folder (by default **.config**)

[using gatsby](/tutorial/#configure-theme)

## Configuration files

There are two main configuration files:

1. [build-time](/configuration/buildtime/) configuration file is used during the webpack build process. This file runs under a `nodejs` environment and you can access libraries such `path` and `fs`. However, you can not access browser-specific features such as `document` global variables or front-end libraries.

2. [run-time](/configuration/runtime/)  configuration file is used to configure the generated site. This file runs under the `browser` environment and can you can access any browser-specific libraries and global variables. However, from this file, you can not access `nodejs`-specific libraries.
