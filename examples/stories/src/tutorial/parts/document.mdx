## Overview

Document is a single file containing documentation in [mdx](/tutorial/mdx-stories/) or [esm](/tutorial/esmodules-stories/) format.

## Properties

### title

type: `string`

Title of the document, also used as the document unique identifier. If no [route](#route) parameter is specifified, the title is used to generate the document url. This is the only required field, as it is used to show the document in the menu structures.

[MDX](/tutorial/mdx-documentation)
```
---
title: Library/Components/Button
---
```

[ESM](/tutorial/esmodules-stories)
```
export default {
  title: 'Library/Components/Button',
}  
```

<img alt="hierarchical document title" title="document title" src={titleImg} />

## Type

type: [DocType](/tutorial/structure/configuration#doctype)

Document type - blogs, pages, stories and even custom ones. By default all documents are of type `story`

All documents of the same type are grouped together for easier search and navigation.

### order

type: `number`

Document order, used to sort between documents within the same parent menu. By default documents are ordered by their filesystem precendance (alphabetically).

The order is used for the menu display as well as next/previous page navigation.

as an example, lets suppose you have the following 3 documents:

```
// first.mdx
---
title: Components/One
---

// second.mdx
---
title: Components/Two
---

// third.mdx
---
title: Components/Three
---

```

From the file-system order, the documents will be ordered first.mdx, second.mdx and third.mdx (ordered by their file name alphabetically). However we can order the files manually and sort them first.mdx, third.mdx and second.mdx.

```
// first.mdx
---
title: Components/One
order: 0
---

// second.mdx
---
title: Components/Two
order: 2
---

// third.mdx
---
title: Components/Three
order: 1
---

```
