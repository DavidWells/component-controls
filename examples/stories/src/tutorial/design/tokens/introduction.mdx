## Overview

Design tokens are the building blocks of your of the design-system to describe the visual appearance of your application. They can describe the colors, spacing, typography, elevation, icons, and other elements part of the design-system.

Design tokens were introduced in 2016 by Jina Bolton and Jon Levine at their Salesforce Lightning Design System talk.

## Install

The [design-tokens](https://github.com/ccontrols/component-controls/tree/master/ui/design-tokens) package contains a collection of design tokens components.

```sh
yarn add @component-controls/design-tokens --dev
```

## Components

`design-tokens` comes with multiple design-tokens components that can be used out of the box to document your design system. 

The designs of the `design-tokens` package components are based on some of the industry-best design systems, as noted in each component's documentation. However, they are not guaranteed to be 100% identical and they are not endorsed in any way by their original creators.

A handy list of design-systems can be found on [designsystemsrepo.com](https://designsystemsrepo.com/design-systems/).
