# Getting started with Gatsby

## Install

```sh
yarn add gatsby-theme-stories
```

## Configure

the default options will configure `componnet-controls` to work with react apps,  with `reac-docgen` for prop-types and `react-docgen-typescript` for typescript props information

in `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
  plugins: [
    ...
    {
      resolve: '@component-controls/gatsby-theme-stories',
      options: {
        //path to the configuration files
        configPath: '.config',
      },
    },
    ...
  ],

```
