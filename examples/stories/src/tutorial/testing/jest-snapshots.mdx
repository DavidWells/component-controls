## Overview

The [jest-snapshots](https://github.com/ccontrols/component-controls/tree/master/plugins/jest-snapshots) package automatically creates snapshot tests for your component based on the already created documentation stories.

-   Easy to use cli with "zero" configuration.
-   More advanced level to customize the framework renderer.
-   Advanced level for full control over which stories to use for the tests.
-   Support for a variety of test rendderes starting with [react-test-renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html), [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) and [enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/).

## Install

```sh
yarn add @component-controls/jest-snapshots --dev
```

## CLI - `cc-jest`

The command-line interface for jest-snapshots allows for the quickest, zero-config setup. You just need to add a `test` script to your `package.json` file

```js:title=package.json
"scripts": {
  ...
  "test": "cc-jest -c ./.config"
},
```
