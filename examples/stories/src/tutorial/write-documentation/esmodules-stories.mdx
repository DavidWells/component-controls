## Overview

You can create interactive component examples (aka stories) in pure Javascript or Typescript.

To do so, you need to create a [default export](#metadata) with at least a title attribute and at least one [named export](#stories), which is considered a story.

## Advantages

The ESM format has the following advantages:

- The documentation, testing and design pages are created automatically.
- Since ESM are regular javascript or typescript files, you get full support from your IDE and linting tools.

The ESM format has the following dis-advantages:

- For control over the documentation pages, you need to use advanced features such as replacing the pages and tabs.
- You can not easily embed custom documentation into the pages

## File extensions

By default, your ESM story files should end with `.(story|stories).(js|jsx|ts|tsx)`. An example of a valid ESM typescript file would be `my-story.stories.tsx`;


## Metadata

All the document metadata is exported as the default module export (there can be only one default export per es module). For example the document(page) title, component etc. are defined as properties:

```
export default {
  title: 'My Story'
}
```

## Stories

The stories (live examples of your components) are defined as named exports

```
export const myStory = <Button>some text</Button>;
```

### Story properties

You can attach properies to you stories either directly:

```
export const myStory = <Button>some text</Button>;

myStory.description = 'A button example with some text'
```

Or using the `story` namespace:

```
export const myStory = <Button>some text</Button>;

myStory.story = {
  description: 'A button example with some text',
  ...
};
 
```
