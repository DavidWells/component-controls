## Overview

You can create interactive component examples (aka stories) in pure Javascript or Typescript. 

To do so, you need to create a [default export](#metadata) with at least a title attribute and at least one [named export](#stories), which is considered a story.

Our ESM story format is loosely compatible with Storybook's [CSF](https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/component-story-format/) with a few properties in common (ie title, component, decorators). However, our ESM story format is fully extensible beyond just using a select few hard-coded props (ie parameters).

## Advantages

The ESM format has the following advantages:

- The documentation, testing, and design pages are created automatically.
- Since ESM are regular javascript or typescript files, you get full support from your IDE and linting tools.

The ESM format has the following disadvantages:

- For control over the documentation pages, you need to use advanced features such as replacing the pages and tabs.
- You can not easily embed custom documentation into the pages

## File extensions

By default, your ESM story files should end with `.(story|stories).(js|jsx|ts|tsx)`. An example of a valid ESM typescript file would be `my-story.stories.tsx`;


## Metadata

All the document metadata is exported as the default module export (there can be only one default export per es module). For example the document(page) title, component, etc. are defined as properties:

```
export default {
  title: 'My Story'
}
```

## Stories

The stories (live examples of your components) are defined as named exports

```
export const myStory = <Button>some text</Button>;
```

### Story properties

You can attach properties to you stories either directly:

```
export const myStory = <Button>some text</Button>;

myStory.description = 'A button example with some text'
```

Or using the `story` namespace:

```
export const myStory = <Button>some text</Button>;

myStory.story = {
  description: 'A button example with some text',
  ...
};
 
```

### Dynamic stories

You can create multiple stories dynamically from a function To do this, all you need is to add `dynamic = true` flag to the exported story:

```
import React from 'react';
import { theme } from '@component-controls/components';

export default {
  title: Components/Button',
};

export const buttonColors = () => {
  return Object.keys(theme.colors)
    .filter(color => typeof theme.colors[color] === 'string')
    .map(color => {
      return {
        name: color,
        source: `<Button sx={{ bg: '${color}'}}>Color ${color}: ${theme.colors[color]}</Button>`,
        renderFn: () => (
          <Button
            sx={{ bg: color }}
          >{`Color ${color}: ${theme.colors[color]}`}</Button>
        ),
      };
    });
};

buttonColors.dynamic = true;
```
[live example](/api/introduction-dynamic-stories--button-colors/?story=Background)

> dynamic stories are created at run-time (when the site loads in the browser), while in the case of [gatsby](/tutorial/getting-started/gatsby), the static page routes are created under a `nodejs` process. This makes it so all the newly created dynamic stories for `gatsby` will reside under the URL of the dynamic parent story, with a `story` parameter: `https://xxx/api/components-button--button-colors/?story=Background`

### Async stories

Sometimes, you might need to fetch data in your stories, and component-controls can automatically detect async arrow function or regular functions

```
// async arrow function
export const asyncStory = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    'http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employee/1',
  );
  const { data } = await response.json();
  return () => <h2>{`Hello, my name is ${data.employee_name}.`}</h2>;
};

// async function
export async function asyncFunction() {
  const response = await fetch(
    'http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employee/1',
  );
  const { data } = await response.json();
  return () => <h2>{`Hello, my name is ${data.employee_name}.`}</h2>;
}
```

> Note that you can also fetch data using react's useEffect hooks, without the need fot async stories.
