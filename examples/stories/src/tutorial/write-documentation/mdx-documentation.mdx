# MDX

MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents.
You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast :rocket:.

# Frontmatter

When creating MDX documentation files, you can include a set of key value pairs that can be used to provide structured data. The format used is known as [frontmatter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)

```yaml
---
title: My Document
route: /tutorials/mydoc
type: tutorial
tags:
  - mdx
  - documentation
order: 0
---
```

# Import React components

In MDX, you can import any react components and use them to create rich documentation pages:

```jsx
---
title: My Button
---
import { Button } from 'theme-ui';

<Button onClick={() => alert('clicked')}>click me</Button>
```


# Transclusion

MDX allows you to import external MDX and MD files statically and display their content:

```jsx
---
title: Test Transclusion
---
import Transclusion from '../sections/transclusion.mdx';

<Transclusion />
```
