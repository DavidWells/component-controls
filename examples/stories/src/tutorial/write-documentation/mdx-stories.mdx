## Overview

You can create interactive components examples (aka stories) similar to [ES Modules](/tutorial/esmodules-stories/) in [MDX](/tutorial/mdx-documentation/)

To do so, you need to import some components from **'@component-controls/blocks'** and use them inside your MDX files

## Example

```
---
title: First Story
---
import { Button } from '../components/Button';
import { Playground, Story, PropsTable,  ComponentSource, StorySource  } from '@component-controls/blocks';

# My first doc story

<ComponentSource of={Button} title='Component source' />

<Playground description="Button story">
  <Story name="simple">
    <Button>
      click me
  </Button>
  </Story>
</Playground>

<StorySource id="." />

<PropsTable of={Button} />
```
