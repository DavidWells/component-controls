## Overview

`component-controls` allows using 3 different static site generators (SSG) to create the production version of your documentation sites.

- [gastby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) - in many aspects gatsby is the original static sites generator for react and continues to be a leader in this space.
- [nextjs](https://nextjs.org) - for many years, nextjs was known for ssr, however recent builds allow creating highly optimized static sites.
- [storybook](https://storybook.js.org) - while storybook is not a general-purpose SSG, it comes with its own webpack bundler module.

 In this blog post we will research which solution offers the best development and production experience.

## Examples source

The documentation sites used throughout this post are essentially the same for the purpose of comparison. We would truly appreciate any feedback to additionaly optimize our examples for the researched SSGs.

| gatsby      |  [github](https://github.com/ccontrols/component-controls/tree/master/examples/gatsby) |

| storybook   |  [github](https://github.com/ccontrols/component-controls/tree/master/examples/storybook-6-no-docs) |


## Live sites

All the sites are hosted on a free tier at [nettlify](https://www.netlify.com). The tests are conducted on the same simple documentation page.

## Performance tools

The web tests are condicted with [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org) and [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). The local times are measured manually after clearing the local chache for each SSG.
