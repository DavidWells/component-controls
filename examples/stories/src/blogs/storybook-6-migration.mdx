# Migration from Storybook 6

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) is an open-source tool for developing stories (aka examples) of your UI components.

Component-controls provides migration compatibility for many of the story(examples) and documentation features in Storybook. And component-controls can also use [gatsby](/tutorial/getting-started/gatsby) or [nextjs](/tutorial/getting-started/nextjs) as a static site generator to provide ample performance improvements.

This is a 3-parts article that will guide you step-by-step through converting a Storybook 6 with Docs documentation project to component-controls using various static site generators:

-- [Storybook](/blogs/storybook-6-migration-storybook-ssg) as the static site generator (SSG)

[source code](https://github.com/ccontrols/tailwind-storybook-controls-starter)

[live site](https://tailwind-storybook-controls-starter.netlify.app/?path=/docs-page/components-button--primary)

-- [Gatsby](/blogs/storybook-6-migration-gatsby-ssg) as the static site generator (SSG)

[source code](https://github.com/ccontrols/tailwind-gatsby-controls-starter)

[live site](https://tailwind-gatsby-controls-starter.netlify.app)

-- [Nextjs](/blogs/storybook-6-migration-nextjs-ssg) as the static site generator (SSG)

[source code](https://github.com/ccontrols/tailwind-nextjs-starter)

[live site](https://tailwind-nextjs-controls-starter.netlify.app)

> The sample project was cloned from [tw-sb-rtl-starter](https://github.com/ssengalanto/tw-sb-rtl-starter)

This project was bootstrapped with CRA and covers handling of typescript, tailwind css files, react testing library and other best of class practices
