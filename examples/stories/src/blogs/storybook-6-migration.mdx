# Migration from Storybook 6

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) is an open-source tool for developing stories (aka examples) of your UI components.

When using component-controls to create stories, docs, and more, you can choose [Gatsby](/tutorial/getting-started/gatsby), [Nextjs](/tutorial/getting-started/nextjs) or Storybook's own SSG as your static site generator (SSG). We recommend you use either Gatsby or Nextjs as your SSG because of how much faster they are than Storybook. We do an analysis these SSGs' performance [here](blogs/gatsby-vs-nextjs-vs-storybook).

We'll guide you step-by-step through converting a Storybook 6 project to component-controls using each of these various static site generators.

The sample project we'll be using for this guide is a Tailwind, Typescript, Storybook 6, and React Testing Library starter repo, and you can find it [here](https://github.com/ssengalanto/tw-sb-rtl-starter).

Below are the guides for converting this Storybook 6 site to your preferred SSG:

-- [Storybook](/blogs/storybook-6-migration-storybook-ssg) as the SSG. Here is the [source code](https://github.com/ccontrols/tailwind-storybook-controls-starter) and the [live version](https://tailwind-storybook-controls-starter.netlify.app/?path=/docs-page/components-button--primary) of the final site.

-- [Gatsby](/blogs/storybook-6-migration-gatsby-ssg) as the SSG. Here is the [source code](https://github.com/ccontrols/tailwind-gatsby-controls-starter) and the [live version](https://tailwind-gatsby-controls-starter.netlify.app/docs/components-button--primary) of the final site.

-- [Nextjs](/blogs/storybook-6-migration-nextjs-ssg) as the SSG. Here is the [source code](https://github.com/ccontrols/tailwind-nextjs-controls-starter) and the [live version](https://tailwind-nextjs-controls-starter.netlify.app/docs/components-button--primary) of the final site.
